#Welcome to the Goal Kicker Simulator! Guess where a third card falls relative to two cards and test your betting strategy.

How to Play:
Two cards set a range (e.g., 3 and 7). Guess if the third card is:
Within: Between them (e.g., 4, 5, 6).
Outside: Below or above (e.g., 2, 8).
Same: Matches one (e.g., 3 or 7).
The first two cards always have different ranks.
Modes:
Interactive: See two cards, guess Within/Outside/Same, and check the result (no betting).
Auto: Run one trial with betting, see cards for 1 second, and track results.
Run Trials: Run multiple trials (e.g., 17) with betting, each shown for 1 second.
Settings:
Deck:
Reshuffle Each Time: New deck every trial.
Use Same Deck: Draw until <3 cards left, then reshuffle (shown in table).
Betting:
Set Payouts: Enter Bet (>0), Within, Outside, Same payouts. Earn Payout - Bet (e.g., Within: 2 - 1 = 1).
Guess Within/Outside: Enter Bet, Win, Lose, Same payouts. The game auto-picks the range with more cards (Within if tied). Earn Win/Lose/Same - Bet.
Results:
Auto and Run Trials show a table (e.g., “Ace-Spades | Five-Hearts | Seven-Clubs | Out | -1 | -1”).
Stats track trials, outcomes, and payouts. Reset stats anytime.
Have fun and good luck!
